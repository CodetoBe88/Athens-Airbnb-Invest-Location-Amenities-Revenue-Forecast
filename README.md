# Athens-Airbnb-Invest-Location-Amenities-Revenue-Forecast
I am thinking about starting an Airbnb business in Athens - either buying or renting an apartment to host on the platform. Since I am not familiar with the city, I would like to know 
1.Which neighborhoods should I consider? 
2.What equipment and furnishings will maximize my occupancy? 
3. How can I estimate the expected revenue for a new listing?
For all three questions we'll use Airbnb data, which contains the necessary information.
