## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The librarys that I was using for running the code are the following: 
1. pip install matplotlib
2. pip install s3fs
3. pip install numpy
4. pip install pandas
5. pip install wordcloud
6. pip install -U scikit-learn
7. pip install statsmodels
   
## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
I am thinking about starting an Airbnb business in Athens - either buying or renting an apartment to host on the platform. Since I am not familiar with the city, I would like to know:

1.Which neighborhoods should I consider? 

2.What equipment and furnishings will maximize my occupancy?

3.How can I estimate the expected revenue for a new listing?

Based on the Airbnb data available, I will use the notebooks to answer the questions above. These notebooks will also serve as practical exercises for the Udacity project, documenting the analysis and methods used.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
Two notebooks are provided to address the questions above:

First project-Q1&Q2.py — covers questions 1 and 2.

First project-Q3.py — covers question 3.

Both notebooks include markdown cells that explain the reasoning and workflow step by step, and contain images to illustrate key results.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@jonida.nakofranke/athens-airbnb-invest-location-amenities-revenue-forecast-77d5637b8c27).

In summary, we now know which neighborhoods to target when searching for an apartment, which amenities to invest in to make it more attractive to guests, and how to estimate the expected annual revenue. 
This project provides a high-level overview and does not include detailed cost calculations for the apartment.
